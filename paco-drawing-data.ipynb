    "I *manually* collect data from all 1,900+ (and counting) drawings from an experienced furry artist and illustrator, Paco (aka pandapaco, or Paco Panda). The data will collect things such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name and date of the artwork\n",
    "- Species and character names\n",
    "- Number of character in each artwork\n",
    "- Facial expressions\n",
    "- Medium (either drawn digitally or traditional with exceptions of programs and tools used)\n",
    "- Source (either from FurAffinity or DeviantArt)\n",
    "\n",
    "I was also planning to get the most colors used, as in only in each characters, excluding backgrounds, items, etc. However, because I have deal with shading and color correction, it will be a tedious and cumbersome dataset to obtain; yes we can refer it to their fursona's ref sheet and get the colors that way but there are some cases that it won't be available, so for now - I won't add this dataset."
