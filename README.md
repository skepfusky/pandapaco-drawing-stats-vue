This website collects all 1.9K drawings from a furry artist and illustrator
*pandapaco*, and displays different types of data (i.e species drawn, expressions,
number of characters drawn, etc, which are, for now, probably, hard-coded
unfortunately)

For more in-depth explanation on how I gather data, refer to the [`paco-drawing-data.ipynb`](https://github.com/skepfusky/pandapaco-art-statistics/blob/main/paco-drawing-data.ipynb) file.

## History

This project collects title and date of the piece, character's species and names,
facial expressions, and the source where I got the data from. This task seem
daunting since I have to source it through FurAffinity and DeviantArt for his
draft drawings. Unfortunately, drawings from Twitter won't be counted in order to ease
the load on my end and the dataset as well since all the data gathered will be
hardcoded to the site.

This project began in October 31, 2021, and the possible inspiration from this
project is through the McDonald's broken ice cream machine site and it'd be
interesting to see in all 1.9K drawings to see said data.

## Managing data and... why?

For the why part, it's initially not meant to impress him in general, but he'd
for sure find it interesting as it's more of a fun project to a new hobby
of mine, learning not only JavaScript and Vue.js, but also learning a bit of
back-end and basic data management using Firebase in the process of other
projects I do.

I wanted to show realtime data from Google Sheets and render data via charts
from a website and I'd thought I'll take one of my artists and run it through
this process. (Well, I lied, as I mentioned earlier, all data will be hard-coded
to the site)

Like I mentioned, the entire data will be hard-coded and I'll try to figure out
to update it automatically through a database. For now, I have [this Google Sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fpNL-qbfZ53H-6WdqEB2X9rwn9QmM1porJqKgBC7rPk/edit?usp=sharing)
 to catalog and manage various datasets mentioned in the beginning of this README.
